# parameters in the denovo reference creation:
# identity: percentage of sequence identity in the last clustering step, in decimal number e.g. for 90% identity write 0.90, default 0.95
# min-depth: minimal cluster depth in the first clustering step to include a cluster, default 0
# max-depth: maximal cluster depth in the first clustering step to include a cluster, default 0

  min-depth: ""
  max-depth: ""

# parameters in the mpileup step (variant callin)
# max-depth: At a position, read maximally INT reads per input file, default 10000000, check if mpileup automatically reduced the maximal depth even more. You might have to re-run your analysis with a lower max-depth value to avoid this.
# min-MQ: Minimum mapping quality for an alignment to be used, default 0
# min-BQ: Minimum base quality for a base to be considered, default 15
